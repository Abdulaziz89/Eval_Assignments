The Assignment

Create a Dev Hub Portal — a front-end system for developers that serves as a central resource.

The portal should help new developers get onboarded, allow users to discover recommended tools and IDEs, offer a library of reusable UI components, list useful APIs with documentation links, and include a simple survey module for collecting feedback.

Portal Features

Onboarding Section

A welcoming landing page with brief guides or tutorials for new developers.

Tools & IDEs Directory

A listing (grid or list view) of recommended development tools and IDEs.

Each item should display:

Name

Short description

Link for more details

Reusable Components Library

A list of several UI components (e.g., buttons, forms, cards).

Live previews of each component.

Accompanying code snippets for easy implementation.

APIs & Resources Section

A resource hub that lists useful public APIs for developers.

Each API should include:

A brief description

Link to documentation

Survey Module

A simple survey to collect user feedback.

Aggregated results displayed, e.g., using a basic chart.

Backend Requirements

Use mocked data or static JSON files.

A functional backend is not required.

Extra Credit Features

Include unit tests for critical components.

Enhance UI/UX with extra polish, animations, or advanced responsive design techniques.

Good luck.
