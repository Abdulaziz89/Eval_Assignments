# The Assignment

## Create a Dev Hub Portal
A front-end system for developers that serves as a central resource.

The portal should help new developers get onboarded, allow users to discover recommended tools and IDEs, offer a library of reusable UI components, list useful APIs with documentation links, and include a simple survey module for collecting feedback.

## Portal Features

### Onboarding Section
- A welcoming landing page with brief guides or tutorials for new developers.

### Tools & IDEs Directory
- A listing (grid or list view) of recommended development tools and IDEs.
- Each item should display:
  - **Name**
  - **Short description**
  - **Link for more details**

### Reusable Components Library
- A list of several UI components (e.g., buttons, forms, cards).
- Live previews of each component.
- Accompanying code snippets for easy implementation.

### APIs & Resources Section
- A resource hub that lists useful public APIs for developers.
- Each API should include:
  - **A brief description**
  - **Link to documentation**

### Survey Module
- A simple survey to collect user feedback.
- Aggregated results displayed, e.g., using a basic chart.

## Backend Requirements
- Use mocked data or static JSON files.
- A functional backend is not required.

## Extra Credit Features
- Include unit tests for critical components.
- Enhance UI/UX with extra polish, animations, or advanced responsive design techniques.

**Good luck.**
